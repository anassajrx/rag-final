This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that processes multiple PDFs to generate context-aware responses to user queries. It leverages LangChain, ChromaDB, HuggingFace Embeddings, and Google Gemini for embedding, retrieval, and answer generation, with Streamlit providing a simple front-end interface.
